# Simple-Blockchain

### Motivation
All the current implementations of blockchains are tightly coupled with the larger context and problems they (e.g. Bitcoin or Ethereum) are trying to solve. This makes understanding blockchains a necessarily harder task, than it must be. Especially source-code-wisely. This project is an attempt to provide as concise and simple implementation of a blockchain as possible.

 
### What is blockchain
[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database)) : Blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of records called blocks secured from tampering and revision.

### Key concepts of Naivechain
* NodeJS implementation for creating webapp to process blockchain
* HTTP interface to control the node
* Use Websockets to communicate with other nodes (P2P)
* Super simple "protocols" in P2P communication
* Data is not persisted in nodes
* No proof-of-work or proof-of-stake: a block can be added to the blockchain without competition


### Quick start
```
npm install
npm start
```

### HTTP API
##### Get blockchain
```
http://localhost:3000/getBlockChain
```
##### Create block
```
http://localhost:3000/addBlock
```
